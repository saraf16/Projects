# Projects
These are some projects that I have worked on while studying in University of Reykjavik.   
Two are Python projects that I did in a Python course:   
* orginacing_folder.py is a programm that is made to organise a folder that is full of movies and tv shows that originates the tv shows into new folders and for each show and in to seasons.
* poker_hand.py you put in a 5 card and it will tell you if you have a hand:
  - C - clubs
  - D - diamonds
  - H - hearts
  - S - spades  
  

Two are in C++ project that I did in a Data Structurs course that i late was a TA in:
* Hangman is a game that you guess the word. You put in your name, then you are asked if you want to add a new word to the game, after that you get to pick how many guesses you want, then the game starts.
* Prefix Parser is a program which takes input in the form of prefix notation, also called polish notation, i.e. / 10 5 and returns the outcome which is 2.  
Also here is a git reposotiru for a 3 week course I did on my first year with 5 other students in C++: https://github.com/bennisverrir/Golfing-Union-of-Ireland
