# Projects
These are 4 projects that I have worked on while studying in University of Reykjavik.   
Two are Python projects that I did in a Python course:   
* orginacing_folder.py is a scripta that is made to organise a folder that is full of movies and tv shows that originates the tv shows into new folders and for each show and in to seasons.
* poker_hand.py is a function that takes an array that is 5 cards, i.e ['9C', 'JH', 'JC', 'QC', '8D'] and return the user there hand.
  - C - clubs
  - D - diamonds
  - H - hearts
  - S - spades  
  - A - Ace
  - K - King
  - Q - Queen
  - J - Jack
  - T - Ten
  
Two are in C++ projects that I did in a Data Structure course that I later was a TA in:
* Hangman is a game where you have to guess the word. User gets an input to put in a name, then is asked if they want to add a new orld to the game. Adter that they get to pick how many guesses they want, Then the game starts.
* Prefix Parser is a program which takes input in the form of prefix notation, also called polish notation, i.e. / 10 5 and returns the outcome which is 2 in this case.  


Also here is a Git repository for a 3 week course I did on my first year with 5 other students in C++: https://github.com/bennisverrir/Golfing-Union-of-Ireland
